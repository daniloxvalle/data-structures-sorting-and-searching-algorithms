# Data Structures, Sorting, and Searching Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures:

* Linked List: A linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
* Stack: A linear data structure which follows a Last In First Out (LIFO) order for operations. In this implementation, a Stack is composed of Node elements. Each Node contains data and a reference to the next Node. The Stack has a head (the top element) and a size (the number of elements).
* Tree: A widely used abstract data type (ADT) that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node.

## Searching Algorithms:

* Binary Search: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.


## Sorting Algorithms:

* Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
* Quick Sort: An efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order.
* Merge Sort: An efficient, stable sorting algorith that makes use of the divide and conquer strategy.
* Insertion Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
